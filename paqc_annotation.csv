The split reads (reads not mapped in contiguous manner) were collected using tool samblaster (Faust and Hall, 2014). If one tag of a paired read is mapped contiguously (one entry in mapped file) and other tag is mapped in a split manner (two entries in mapped file) then the particular read id will have three entries in alignment file. We therefore collected all the read pair IDs that mapped to three unique sites in the genome from the alignment file. Next we collected the split reads that mapped uniquely at two positions on the same chromosome and in the same orientation. Returning to the list of paired end IDs that mapped uniquely to three sites in the genome, we identified paired end IDs where the contiguously mapped read is between the two split reads and on the opposite strand. From this list we annotate a circle if we find at least one junctional sequence.
